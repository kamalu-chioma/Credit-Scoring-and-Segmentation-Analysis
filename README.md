# Credit-Scoring-and-Segmentation-Analysis

**Author**: *Chioma Kamalu*  
**Last Updated**: 24 February  

## üìò Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end analysis of **credit scoring** and **segmentation** using a synthetic dataset of 1,000 entries. Credit scoring is a critical aspect of financial risk analysis, helping organizations assess the creditworthiness of individuals. The project also explores segmentation based on credit scores to categorize individuals into risk-based clusters.

## üèÜ Objectives
1. **Understand Credit Scoring Factors**:  
   Examine key factors influencing credit scores, including:
   - Credit Utilization Ratio
   - Payment History
   - Number of Credit Accounts
   - Education Level
   - Employment Status

2. **Visualize Distributions and Trends**:  
   Use visualizations to analyze features like:
   - Distribution of credit utilization ratios and loan amounts.
   - Correlation between different variables.

3. **Calculate Credit Scores**:  
   Utilize a custom formula based on **FICO scoring principles** to calculate credit scores for each individual.

4. **Customer Segmentation**:  
   Perform segmentation using **K-Means clustering** to group customers based on their credit scores into categories:
   - Excellent
   - Good
   - Low
   - Very Low

5. **Generate Insights**:  
   Provide actionable insights for understanding customer creditworthiness and risk segmentation.

## üìä Key Outputs
1. **Credit Score Distribution**:
   - Visualized using histograms and box plots.
2. **Segmentation Insights**:
   - Scatter plots of credit scores grouped by segment.
   - Statistical summaries of segments.
3. **Cluster Labels**:
   - Map cluster indices to descriptive categories (e.g., "Excellent").
